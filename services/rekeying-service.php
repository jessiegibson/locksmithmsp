            <h1>ReKeying Locks</h1>
            
            <p>Rekeying locks is simply changing the lock so that different key may
                operate it. Rekeing is done when a lock owner may be concerned 
                that unauthorized persons have keys to the lock, so the lock 
                may be altered by a professional Locksmith so that only the new
                keys will work.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Rekeying Lock Process</h2>
            
            <p>Rekeing is a relatively simple process of changing the tumbler or
                wafer configuration of the lock so that you will be able to use
                a new key. This keeps the same lock but uses a brand new key.
                Rekeying is done without replacing the entire lock.
            </p>
            
            <h2>History of Rekeying</h2>
            
            <p>Rekeying has been around since 1836 when Solomon Andrews, a locksmith
                from New Jersey invented it. His locks had adjustable keys and 
                tumblers, allowing the owner to rekey it at any time. Later in 
                the 1850s, inventors Andrewss and Newell patented removable 
                tumblers which could be taken apart and scrambled. The keys
                had bits that were interchangeable, matching verying configurations
                of tumblers. This arrangement later became the combination locks 
                basis.
            </p>
            
            <p>If you have a lock that you need rekeyed simply pick up the phone 
                and give us a call at <?php echo $phoneNumber; ?>
